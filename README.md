# IAI Project 1 - Othello

### Scope

- Make our own implementation of an adversarial search algotrithm for the game Othello in Java.

- Implement the Minimax-algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.

### Goals

- Make sure of a 'reasonable' response time, i.e. 10s on average.

- Make sure that our AI consistently beats the provided DumAI.

---

### Provided

- OthelluGUI is a GUI class that listens for input from user.

- GameState is a class that represents the state of the game, i.e. state of board and player turns.

- Position is a class that represents position (col, row) on the board.

- Othello is the class with the main-method and takes in some parameters.

- DumAI is a simple implementation of the required interface

- **IOthelloAI is the interface that we need to implement**

## Setup

- **Player 1: Black**
    Either a human or an AI implementing IOthelloAI class
- **Player 2: White**
    AI implementing IOthelloAI class

"Player 1 always plays first"
